There are two ways you can write joins:

1) Theta style: Similar to writing a sub-query.

2) ANSI style: There are keywords provided by ANSI.

MySQL supports ANSI style. Theta style is supported only to certain extent.

In Left Outer Join, all records from left hand side table are guaranteed to come &
records from right hand side table will be those, which match with Left hand side
table.

In Right Outer Join, all records from right hand side table are guaranteed to come &
records from left hand side table will be those, which match with right hand side
table.

Full outer join is not supported in MySQL. Instead we use UNION ALL.

Natural Join is EquiJoin. That means only matching records will come.

Natural Join is not recommended one as it is very dangerous. Sometimes, we drop some columns from one of the table and now no. of common columns are different & hence the recordset to be chosen is also different. You don't come to know this immediately. It is realized when actual results come to picture.

Self-Join is joining table with itself. There are two copies of same table, with different alias. The foreign key of the table is just another column name for primary key.

In Cross Join, one record of left hand side is joined unconditionally with all records of right hand side. Also, known as Cartesian product.
