1) If even one method in a class, is abstract, the class must 
   be declared as abstract.

2) If the entity represented is incomplete, then even if 
   there is no method abstract, still class can be declared 
   as abstract.

3) Abstract classes cannot have objects instantiated, but 
   can store object references of child classes.

4) If child class doesn't implement parent's abstract method, 
   then it becomes abstract as well.

5) A class cannot be abstract as well as final, both at a time.

=============================================================

1) Interface is a 100% abstract class. It cannot have any 
   implementation.

2) Methods declared in interface, are abstract & public by 
   default. Its access modifier cannot be changed.

3) Variables declared in interface are public, static & 
   final. These modifiers cannot be changed.

4) A class can implement one or more interfaces, but cannot
   extend more than one class.

5) An interface can extend one or more interfaces.

6) An interface cannot implement any other interface.
