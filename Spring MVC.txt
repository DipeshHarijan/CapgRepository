Controllers are created to the no. of clients.

That increases no. of Servlets to be created.

Those many servlets need to be documented in web.xml.

This increases the complexity of web application.


There is theorectical solution:
===============================

FrontController.

Concept:
========


	There is only one controller that will attend request & then offload
job of handling request to another class object. This solution can be implemented
in any programming language like C#. So, this is called a design pattern.

Implementation:
===============

. Struts & Spring implement this design patten i.e. Front Controller.

. In Struts, request is attended by Filter & not Servlet. This is against MVC
  architecture, which assumes that role of Controller is to be played by Servlet.

. In Spring, it is perfectly implemented as Spring provides one Servlet i.e.
  DispatcherServlet that will locate another Controller.
